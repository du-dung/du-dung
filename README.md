### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;I'm Hyejin!
I want to be a backend developer. <br>
[Here](https://hyejin.page.link/portfolio) is my portfolio!

I can work with `Springboot`, `Mybatis` and RDBMS like `MariaDB`, `MySQL`. <br>
And I can do the frontend with `vue.js`, but I'm not good at it.

I'm currently working on some projects while studying at SSAFY.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- SpringBoot
- RestAPI
